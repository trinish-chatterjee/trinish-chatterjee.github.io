Hi! My name is Trinish and I'm a PhD Candidate studying **extreme events** under a **changing climate**. I used to be an electrical engineer in the telecom industry before switching fields to pursue my passion: **figuring out how we can adapt to a warming, riskier world**. 

Have a question, interest in collaboration, or just want to connect? I'd love to hear from you!

## Research Interests

My research focuses on quantifying spatiotemporal characteristics of extreme precipitation and extreme heat events at local, regional, and global scales. I'm currently trying to understand:

1. How the spatial scales of extreme events are changing over time in the US and globally, and
2. How we can better characterize the probability distributions of extreme events.

I am interested in applying my research towards:

* Developing new methods to assess the tail risks of rare weather events
* Quantifying exposure to climate hazards
* Informing future climate adaptation decisions

## Current Projects

  <h4>Spatial Scales of Daily Extreme Precipitation in the US and Globally</h4>

    Large-area extreme preciptiation events can highly damaging and can cause numerous risks to emergency response, disaster preparedness, insurance portfolio management, local and downstream flood risk, community resilience. We aim to identify climatology and trends of the area affected by individual daily extreme precipitation events in the US and globally using event-based geospatial analyses of gridded preciptiation data. Our study of spatial scales of extreme precipitation event areas in the US is under review at <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. <a href="https://essopenarchive.org/users/988773/articles/1366178-climatology-and-trends-in-spatial-scales-of-extreme-precipitation-in-the-contiguous-us">(Find our preprint here!)</a>

  <h4>Spatial Scales of Humid Heatwaves in the Southwest US and Northwest Mexico</h4>
  <figure style="float: right; width: 35%; max-width: 350px; margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem;">
    <img src="US_Mexico_Border.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Brooklyn umbrella">
  </figure>
  <p>
    We are working to understand how dry and humid heatwaves are changing across the western half of the US–Mexico Border Region using geospatial methods. Using gridded reanalyses and an event-based framework, we are examining whether humid/nighttime heat stress events are becoming more widespread or penetrating farther inland, with direct implications for cross-border public health and humanitarian risk in a warming climate.

  <h4>Global Data Justice and Quantifying the Intensity of Current and Future Rare Extreme Events</h4>
  <figure style="float: left; width: 35%; max-width: 350px; margin: 0 1rem 0 0;">

  <p>
    We examine how unequal lengths of weather records around the world limit our ability to reliably estimate rare extreme events, such as 1-in-100-year event for heat or rainfall, using a generalized extreme value (GEV) framework. By combining extreme value theory, simulations, and real-world data constraints, we are showing how data scarcity and the underlying climate together amplify uncertainty in high-impact risk estimates, with disproportionate consequences for regions in the Global South and other data-poor areas.
