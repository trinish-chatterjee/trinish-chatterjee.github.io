I used to be an electrical engineer in the telecom industry before switching fields to pursue my passion: figuring out how we can adapt to a warming, riskier world.\nHave a question, interest in collaboration, or just want to connect? I’d love to hear from you!"

I’m currently trying to understand:\n\nHow the spatial scales of extreme events are changing over time in the US and globally, and\nHow we can better characterize the probability distributions of extreme events.\n\nI am interested in applying my research towards:\n\nDeveloping new methods to assess the tail risks of rare weather events\nQuantifying exposure to climate hazards\nInforming future climate adaptation decisions"

We aim to identify climatology and trends of the area affected by individual daily extreme precipitation events in the US and globally using event-based geospatial analyses of gridded preciptiation data. Our study of spatial scales of extreme precipitation event areas in the US is under review at Geophysical Research Letters. (Find our preprint here!)\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Scales of Humid Heatwaves in the Southwest US and Northwest Mexico\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are working to understand how dry and humid heatwaves are changing across the western half of the US–Mexico Border Region using geospatial methods. Using gridded reanalyses and an event-based framework, we are examining whether humid/nighttime heat stress events are becoming more widespread or penetrating farther inland, with direct implications for cross-border public health and humanitarian risk in a warming climate.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Data Justice and Quantifying the Intensity of Current and Future Rare Extreme Events\n\n\n\n\n\nWe examine how unequal lengths of weather records around the world limit our ability to reliably estimate rare extreme events, such as 1-in-100-year event for heat or rainfall, using a generalized extreme value (GEV) framework. By combining extreme value theory, simulations, and real-world data constraints, we are showing how data scarcity and the underlying climate together amplify uncertainty in high-impact risk estimates, with disproportionate consequences for regions in the Global South and other data-poor areas."
